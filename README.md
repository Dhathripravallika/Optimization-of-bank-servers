# Optimization-of-bank-servers
There is bank with multiple servers and each server provide service as its own μ, they shared queue and the analysis is to find the total queue for comparing it to a M/M/s server in which all servers have the same μ.
A simulation of a M/M/m queue was made based on theory of same queue and using Matlab functions, as inputs the code uses lambda, μ and server parameters and as outputs the information about each client, as time in queue, arrival time, time being attended and the server had provided the service. For validate this code the average time spent in queue, the average time spent in system and the average costumers in server was compared to theory using three different situations: one server, four servers and eight servers and for each simulation 100000 iterations were used. In each of these simulations the accuracy was more than 95%, this concluded that the code is a good simulation of a M/M/m queue. By this code a simulation of one bank queue was made, in a bank there is servers fasters than others, so random values were generate to simulate each service rate, under the condition that the sum of all service rate equal to 30 clients by hour, in this simulation the arrival rate of customers was 20 clients by hours and a total of 4 servers were simulated, finally, a comparison between different service rate and same service rate for all server.
